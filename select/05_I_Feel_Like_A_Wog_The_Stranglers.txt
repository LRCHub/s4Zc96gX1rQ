I feel like a wog people giving me the eyes
But I was born here just like y-y-you
I feel like a wog got all the dirt shitty jobs
But everybody's got to have something to d-d-do with their time

I feel like a wog, I don't wanna go home
I've got a lot of life to run t-t-through
I feel like a wog, I don't mean you no harm
Just don't ask me to shine your sh-sh-shoes

Golly gee, golly gosh
Don't call me your golly wog
Golly gee, golly gosh
Don't call me, don't call me, don't call me
Don't call me your golly wog

Well, let me tell you about Pimpo
We met him down at the After Eight
He wanted to sell us some limbo
But we said, "Mister you've just got to wait
You've got to wait, you've got to wait, you've got to wait"

He wanted to take us down to Sao Paulo
But we said mister, we ain't got no friends
I tried to make him laugh, he didn't get the joke
And then he said I wasn't right in the head

And then he made me
And then he made me
And then he made me feel

And then he made me feel like
And then he made me feel like
And then he made me feel like
You know I feel like, you know I feel like
You know I feel like, you know I feel like a wog

I feel like a wog people giving me the eyes
But I was born here just like y-y-you
I feel like a wog, I don't mean you no harm
Just don't ask me to shine your sh-sh-shoes

Golly gee, golly gosh
Don't call me your golly wog
Golly gee, golly gosh
Don't call me, don't call me, don't call me
Don't call me I'll call you if I want to
