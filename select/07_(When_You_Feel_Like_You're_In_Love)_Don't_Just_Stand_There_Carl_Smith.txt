When you feel like you're in love, don't just stand there
When you see that moon above, don't just stand there
You got to laugh and dance and sing, you got to get that gal a ring
When you feel like you're in love, don't just stand there

When the moon is shining bright in your Saturday night
If you're not having any fun, then maybe you're out with the wrong one

When you feel like you're in love, hold her tighter
And the moon and stars above will all shine brighter
You got to laugh and dance and sing, you got to get that gal a ring
When you feel like you're in love, don't just stand there

When you feel like you're in love, don't just stand there
When you see that moon above, don't just stand there
You got to laugh and dance and sing, you got to get that gal a ring
When you feel like you're in love, don't just stand there

When the moon is shining bright in your Saturday night
If you're not having any fun, then maybe you're out with the wrong one

When you feel like you're in love, hold her tighter
And the moon and stars above will all shine brighter
You got to laugh and dance and sing, you got to get that gal a ring
When you feel like you're in love, don't just stand there
